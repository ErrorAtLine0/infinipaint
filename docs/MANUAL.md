## Basic Usage
- Switch to the brush tool, and draw with the mouse by holding <kbd>LMB</kbd> over the canvas. If you have a tablet connected, just draw on the tablet
- To erase, switch to the eraser tool, and draw over the parts you want to erase. For tablets, you can switch to the eraser tool, or you can just use your pen's eraser while the brush tool is selected
- You can move around the canvas by holding the <kbd>MMB</kbd>/mouse wheel button. For tablets, pen button 1 is assigned to the middle mouse button. You can change this by going to Menu->Settings->Tablet->Middle click pen button
- To zoom in/out, use the scroll wheel, or hold the control key and <kbd>MMB</kbd> (pen button 1 on a tablet) and drag the mouse up/down
- Save your file by going to Menu->Save, or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. The shortcut for Save As is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
- Open files by going to Menu->Open, or dragging a file into the window. If the file isn't a .infpnt file, the app will assume that you meant to add a file/image to the canvas, and the file will just be included in the canvas instead
## Online Collaboration
- Before hosting/connecting, you should go to Menu->Settings->General->Display Name, and change your name that will appear to others online
- To host the file you're currently on, go to Menu->Host. Copy the lobby address that pops up, and send it to anyone you want to join the lobby. Once you press "Host" in this popup menu, the lobby will be open
- To connect to a lobby, go to Menu->Connect, paste the lobby address into the given textbox, and press "Connect"
- If either the host or the client need to get the lobby address again, it will be available in Menu->Lobby Info after your enter the lobby
- IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a chance that, even with both people online, you are not able to connect to each other. This could be due to router/firewall settings. I am hosting one relay (TURN) server for this app, but I rely mostly on whether a direct connection can be established between the host and client (STUN).
- Once connected, a chat bubble will pop up on the bottom left. Click that to open the chatbox, type your message, then press the "Send" button. You can also press <kbd>F2</kbd> to open the chatbox, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to send the message. If you want to cancel the message, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or press the chat bubble button again
- Once connected, a list icon will appear at the top right of the screen. Click that to view a list of players on the server. You can jump to any other player's location through this list
## Shortcuts
- To view all available shortcuts/keybinds, go to Menu->Settings->Keybinds
- Note that, for macOS users, the "META" key is the command key
- Shortcuts can be remapped by pressing the button containing the shortcut text, then pressing the new key combination for the shortcut while the button is highlighted
