## InfiniPaint

InfiniPaint is a **collaborative, infinite** canvas note-taking/drawing app. Unlike many other infinite canvas apps, **there is no zoom-in or zoom-out limit** (at least up until the point your computer runs out of memory). This means that this app is very good at things such as drawing sketches of the solar system to scale, or just drawing any massive objects with tiny details. Of course, even though this is a feature, this app is also perfectly well suited for use as a normal canvas.

You can try the web version of this app at [infinipaint.com](https://infinipaint.com) (requires a WebGL2 capable browser). The web version was compiled from C++ to Javascript using Emscripten, and may contain some bugs, so if possible, please consider downloading the native version for a better experience.

This app was inspired by [Lorien](https://github.com/mbrlabs/Lorien), another great infinite canvas program.

## Installation
- **Windows:** Available in [Releases](https://github.com/erroratline0/infinipaint/releases/latest) page. There are two versions:
  	- Installer version. Recommended, since it automatically associates .infpnt files with InfiniPaint
  	- Portable version, which is a zip file containing the executable and data files, and stores configuration files next to the executable. Not recommended unless you are specifically looking for a portable version
- **macOS:** Available in [Releases](https://github.com/erroratline0/infinipaint/releases/latest) page. Only for Apple Silicon
- **Linux:** It is recommended that you download from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.infinipaint.infinipaint) to stay updated. Otherwise, there are flatpak bundles available for download on the [Releases](https://github.com/erroratline0/infinipaint/releases/latest) page for both x86_64 and arm64
